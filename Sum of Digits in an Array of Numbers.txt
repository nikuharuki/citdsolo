Sum of Digits
Description: instead of calculating the sum of the digits in a single number, 
we calculate the sum of the digits in each number of the array and then sum up 
all those digit sums to obtain the final result.

Instructions:
Initialize an array with at least 5 numbers.
Calculate the sum of the digits in each number of the array.
Calculate the sum of all the digit sums obtained.
Print the sum of the digit sums.

Sample Output:
// [123, 45, 6789, 10, 555]
Digit sums: [6, 9, 30, 1, 15]
Sum of digit sums: 61
